          <p>
            Moringa School’s Access Program aims to make world-class technical
            education possible for individuals who would otherwise not be able
            to access it. Our goal is to expose adolescents and adults to the
            field of technology and ultimately promote long and successful
            careers in the field. Our competitive scholarship program sponsors
            young high school graduates from disadvantaged backgrounds to attend
            Moringa School. Our SPOC (Secondary School Practical Open-Source
            Curriculum) program is an after school secondary school course,
            which teaches high school students how to code for free.

          <h2>Access scholarship program</h2>
          <p>
            The Access Scholarship Program at Moringa exists to empower students
            from disadvantaged backgrounds with the skills they need to craft
            better lives for themselves and be the agents of change in their
            communities. The program does this by providing opportunities to
            deserving students who are passionate about technology, but do not
            have the means to pursue an education.
          </p>
          <p>The <em>Scholarship Program</em> has two components:</p>
          <ol class="firstlist">
            <li>Academic support</li>
            <li>Psychosocial support</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>1. Academic Support</h3>
          <p>
            Students in Moringa’s Access Scholarship Program have a slightly
            different academic calendar than other schools. The Moringa’s Access
            scholars start off in Pre-Prep, where they gain basic coding skills
            and learn the mindsets needed to succeed in the courses that follow
            (Prep and Core) and eventually, the workplace. The whole program
            lasts 24 weeks: 4 weeks in Moringa Pre-Prep, 5 weeks in Moringa Prep
            and 15 weeks in Moringa Core.
          </p>
          <p>Moringa Access scholars also receive:</p>
          <ol class="list2">
            <li>Laptops and internet bundles</li>
            <li>Extra classes and individualized learning plans</li>
            <li>Proactive support to prevent student dropout</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>2. Psychosocial support</h3>
          <p>
            At Moringa, we recognize the challenges students from disadvantaged
            backgrounds face in pursuing higher education. Hence, we have
            designed a robust psychosocial support program to help students cope
            with personal, family or community adversaries that may affect their
            productivity in class and their success in the program. The
            psychosocial support component of the Moringa Access Scholarship
            Program includes:
          </p>
          <ol class="list3">
            <li>
              Regular group and individual counseling with a professional
              therapist
            </li>
            <li>
              The Access Buddy Program, where students are paired with a
              classmate to support them with both academic and non-academic
              issues
            </li>
            <li>
              The Access Mentorship Program, where older students and alumni
              share their knowledge and advice to help students navigate their
              time at Moringa and in the workplace
            </li>
            <li>Regular community-building activities</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            So far, the program has served over 90 students. An additional 124
            students are projected to complete the program by the end of 2019.

          <p>Secondary School Practical Open-Source Curriculum (SPOC)</p>
          <p>
            In partnership with UNESCO, Moringa School created the SPOC
            (Secondary School Practical Open-Source Curriculum) program in April
            2017. SPOC aims to introduce high school students across Kenya to
            software engineering and to spur a desire to pursue a career in
            technology. The program ensures students have access to free,
            high-quality coding content at an earlier age than they normally
            would, thus enabling them to become aware of the field of software
            development and make well-informed decisions regarding their
            preferred career path.
          </p>
          <h4>How We Train: Our Pedagogy</h4>
          <p>
            The SPOC vision is to nurture innovative and creative minds at an
            early age by providing high school students access to quality
            programming curriculum and an autonomous learning experience. SPOC
            students learn through a peer-to-peer experience and from high
            school teachers, who serve as their facilitators. This program gives
            young students passionate about software development a head start in
            their careers. SPOC takes place as an extracurricular activity
            outside of class hours, which gives the students the ability to
            enjoy learning practical skills in a club setting. The program
            aspires to teach students how to build fully functioning websites.
          </p>
          <h4>SPOC Content</h4>
          <p>
            The SPOC curriculum is broken down into four yearly levels with
            three terms in each level. In the first level, students learn the
            basic programming skills of HTML and CSS. The second level focuses
            on teaching students JavaScript, a programming language used to
            create web applications. The students then integrate all concepts of
            HTML, CSS and JavaScript in their third year. In their final year,
            students learn jQuery and work on projects for the rest of the year.
          </p>
          <h4>SPOC Camp</h4>
          <p>
            SPOC Camp is a month-long coding boot camp for high school students
            held in Moringa School every school holiday. The program runs every
            Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday from 2:00pm to 4:30pm. The SPOC camp
            imitates the SPOC curriculum. Students go through the curriculum at
            their own pace with a Moringa technical mentor.
          </p>
          <p>
            So far, SPOC has trained approximately 300 students and another 500
            students are projected to complete their training by the end of
            2019..
